<h1>Authors and Acknowledgment</h1>
Thank you to the instructors and TAs. I would also like to acknowledge the starter code which was incredibly helpful. I learned a lot by working with someone else's code - including that changing things like column names can actually create confusion later on. I hope it's not a headache to grade, but it did help me learn to be thorough when going through code.
